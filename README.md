## Array

- **Description**: Arrays are one of the most basic data structures, where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Problems**: This section contains 10 array-related problems, including tasks like finding odd numbers, and more.
- **Key Topics**: Traversal, insertion, deletion, searching, etc.

  ### Find the Maximum Element in an Array

This C program reads a list of numbers from the user, stores them in an array, and then finds the maximum element.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, max;
    printf("Enter number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int arr[n];
    
    printf("Enter elements: ");
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }
    
    max = arr[0];
    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if(arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    
    printf("Maximum element: %d\n", max);
    return 0;
}
```

## Linked List

- **Description**: Linked Lists are a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Problems**: This section includes 10 linked list problems that cover concepts such as node insertion, deletion, reversal, and merging of lists.
- **Key Topics**: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, circular linked list.

## Stack Data Structure

- **Description**: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Problems**: Includes common stack operations and questions related to stack use cases.
- **Key Topics**: Push, pop, top/peek operations, and stack-based algorithms (e.g., parentheses matching).

## Queue Data Structure

- **Description**: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Problems**: Includes queue implementation and related problem-solving.
- **Key Topics**: Enqueue, dequeue, circular queue, priority queue.

## Graph

- **Description**: Graphs are collections of nodes connected by edges. They can be used to represent networks like social networks, computer networks, etc.
- **Problems**: Solutions related to graph traversal, pathfinding, and other graph-based algorithms.
- **Key Topics**: BFS, DFS, adjacency list, adjacency matrix.

## Tree

- **Description**: Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. Trees are a type of graph but without cycles.
- **Problems**: Tree traversal, tree construction, and common tree problems.
- **Key Topics**: Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, tree traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder).

## Searching Algorithms

- **Description**: This section contains solutions for common searching algorithms such as linear search and binary search.
- **Key Topics**: Linear search, binary search, complexity analysis.

## Sorting Algorithms

- **Description**: Sorting algorithms are used to arrange data in a particular order. This section contains implementations of basic sorting algorithms.
- **Key Topics**: Bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, insertion sort, selection sort.

## Pointer

- **Description**: Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable.
- **Key Topics**: Pointer arithmetic, pointer arrays, double pointers, dynamic memory allocation using pointers.
